        Hi, I’m *Andrea* — a Computer Science student at the *University of Tor Vergata*. What fascinates me isn’t just writing code, but understanding the                 concepts that give it structure: **the theories behind programming languages, the logic that shapes computational thinking, and the mathematical ideas that         make these systems coherent and powerful**.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m not the “follow the roadmap” type. I care about fundamentals. I spend a lot of time alone with problems because that’s where I think clearly — no               noise, no shortcuts, no rushing. Just me, the problem, and the drive to push it until the solution stops being merely acceptable and becomes logically              solid and genuinely efficient — the natural consequence of understanding.
        <br>
        <br>
        I don’t follow trends. I don’t solve things “the usual way.” If there’s a path everyone takes, I’ll probably check what’s beside it — the longer, quieter           route where thinking happens, where the best solution reveals itself as the one that fits the problem, not the one that’s fashionable.
        To me, computing is a living theory — a place where reasoning becomes creation. Every concept, from a basic function to an entire system, is a doorway into         understanding how human thought can be transformed into structured, executable logic.
        <br>
        <br>
        This mindset grew from a simple but essential question I asked myself when choosing this path: What ties all of this together?
        Hardware, programming languages, operating systems, networks, algorithms, logic, discrete math, probability, calculus, linear algebra — why are these the           foundations of Computer Science, and how do they connect?
        <br>
        <br>
        That question shaped my way of thinking. Now my focus is clear: to understand the theory behind everything as deeply as possible, because that’s what               separates a programmer from a computer scientist.
        <br>
        <br>
        That’s the path I’ve chosen — and the one I build every day.
