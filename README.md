        Greetings from Rome, Italy! I'm Andrea, a university student and a self-taught software developer. I began my journey in Rome, where life took an unexpected turn that eventually led me to London. It was in London that I truly understood the importance of education through my experiences and started taking online courses to enhance my skills. Upon returning to Rome, I faced significant challenges but turned to programming and completed several important online specializations to rebuild my career. My efforts paid off as I transitioned into freelance development and later secured a position as a programmer in a company. Motivated by a deep-seated passion for learning, I initially enrolled in a computer science program before ultimately discovering my true calling in the realm of physics. Today, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Physics at the University of Tor Vergata, driven by a curiosity and interest in the intricate logic and profound insights that physics offers, as well as the quest to understand the world, the universe and its underlying principles.
    <h5>
        My journey in coding is driven by a strong desire to innovate and excel. Despite the absence of a formal computer science degree, my passion and dedication continue to push me forward. As a self-taught software developer, I recognize that while academic credentials are valuable, continuous learning and skill enhancement are crucial  in our rapidly changing world. Pursuing a bachelor's degree in Physics is equipping me with essential logical and analytical skills, particularly with the inclusion of advanced mathematics. These skills are invaluable for developing scientific algorithms and analyzing complex data, helping me in programming. This dual approach of self-learning and formal education provides a comprehensive foundation. The synergy between independent study and structured coursework significantly enhances my adaptability and problem-solving abilities.
