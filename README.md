    <h3>
        As a self-taught software developer, I've embarked on a journey of endless learning, fueled by passion and determination. Every line of code is a testament to my unwavering commitment to mastering this intricate           art.
        Even though I don't have a bachelor's degree in computer science, my passion for this field is pushing me to new heights. By immersing myself in a diversified academic pathway, venturing beyond programming to embrace computer science theory, mathematics, and physics, I'm gaining knowledge and skills that resonate with the needs of the corporate world.
